# Jokes Teller App

This is a simple web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that tells jokes using two APIs: [JokeAPI](https://jokeapi.dev/) and [VoiceRSS](https://www.voicerss.org/).

## How it Works

The Jokes Teller App uses the JokeAPI to generate random jokes. The user can select a category of jokes or choose to get a random joke. Once a joke is generated, the app uses the VoiceRSS API to convert the text of the joke to speech, which is then played back to the user.

## Getting Started

To use the Jokes Teller App, simply open the index.html file in your web browser.

## APIs Used

This app uses two APIs:

- [JokeAPI](https://jokeapi.dev/): This API provides a variety of jokes in different categories, including programming, knock-knock jokes, and more.
- [VoiceRSS](https://www.voicerss.org/): This API allows the app to convert text to speech, which is used to tell the jokes.

To use this app, you will need to obtain API keys for both JokeAPI and VoiceRSS. Once you have the API keys, you can update the `app.js` file with your keys.
